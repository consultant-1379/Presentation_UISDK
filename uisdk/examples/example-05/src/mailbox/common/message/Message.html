            <p>Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo. The original logo was in use
                from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010. A slightly modified version succeeded the first
                style when the website underwent its first redesign.</p>

            <p>On February 27, 2012, a tweet from an employee that works on the company's platform and API discussed
                the evolution of the "Larry the Bird" logo with Twitter's creative director and it was revealed that it
                was named after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame. This detail had previously been confirmed
                when the Boston Celtics' director of interactive media asked Twitter co-founder Biz Stone about it in
                August 2011.[55]</p>

            <p>On June 5, 2012, Twitter unveiled its third logo redesign, replacing Larry the Bird with an updated icon
                simply named as the "Twitter Bird." As of this logo revision, the word "Twitter" and the lowercase
                letter "t" are no longer used, with the bird becoming the sole symbol for the company's branding.</p>
