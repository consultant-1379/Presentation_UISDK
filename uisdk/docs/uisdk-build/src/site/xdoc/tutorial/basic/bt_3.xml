    <h1>Conditional properties</h1>

    <h2>Variable based on OS</h2>
    <p>
        In "build.json" you can specify variables based on conditions.
        Currently only one type of condition is supported (based on Operating System).
        But in the future there will be a mechanism provided to add new types
        of conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usage:
        ... in "build.json" define your properties like this:
<pre>
"properties": {
    "buildDir": {
        "?os.platform=windows": "target",
        "?os.platform=unix": "unixtarget"
    }
}
</pre>
    </p>

    <h2>Analyse the outcome</h2>
    <p>
        In order to analyse how this variable will change depending on operating system, lets create another phase,
        that will make use of this variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add to new phase to "build.json":
<pre>
"copySomething": {
    "copy": {
        "from": ["build.json"],
        "to": "$(buildDir)/"
    }
}
</pre>
        Remember this phase should go inside "phases" object (valid JSON applies).<br />
        Execute this phase only:
<pre>
uisdk-build copySomething
</pre>
        Once executed verify the name of folder into which "build.json" was
        copied during "copySomething" phase.
    </p>
    <br /><br />
